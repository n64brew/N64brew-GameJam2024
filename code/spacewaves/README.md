### SpaceWaves

This is an experimental turret-defense minigame with the Asteroids vibe to it. 

A station defense is set in various galaxies. Defend yourself from other player's spacecrafts.
Destroy objects to win points! Each player will get a turn (4 rounds max) in a station, and the player with the max score reached wins.
Other 3 players are throwing objects at you and trying to avoid your shots at them, all players can pick up different gameplay bonuses!

## Premise:

In the age of space travel across different galaxies the possibility oh a hostile alien invasion on far outposts is incredibly high!
Using the latest innovations in technology and strategy, the homeplanet Earth decided to launch a special training mission 
for the station defenders across all of its systems, while its best pilots are tasked to destroy you at all costs!

### Take the seat and get the best equipment you can see, because the stakes are out of this world!
