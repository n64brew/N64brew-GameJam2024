# Land Grab

A game for 4 players inspired by the board game "Blokus" by Bernard Tavitian. Claim land and block out your opponents! Try to run out of pieces before you run out of space.

Players are given 21 pieces, each made up of 1-5 squares. Players start by each placing a piece on a corner of the game board. Each turn consists of each player positioning and placing a piece diagonally-connected to their other placed pieces. **Squares of the same color cannot be connected horizontally or vertically: only diagonally.**

The game ends when all players have either run out of pieces or run out of spaces to place pieces.

Players start with -1 point for each square of their unused pieces. When a piece is placed, the player receives 1 point for each square of the piece. If a player uses all of their pieces, they receive a 15 point bonus. If the player's final piece is a Monomino ("one-square") piece, they receive an additional 20 point bonus.
